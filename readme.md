#Atari800 emulator version 5.2.0
-------------------------------

### This is a source fork of the official github repository in [GitHub](https://github.com/atari800/atari800)

For this time I merely set up a configure script in order for the thing to compile under OS/2 Gcc 9.2.0.
The emulator should work, after you provide it the suitable ROM files.
Please notice that still various tasks have to be completed, like
* providing a REXX script to create a WPS object
* adapting the source code to the OS/2 directory structure (I want to access the relevant files in the application directory instead that in the user home directory)
* and maybe something more.




##The original README.md file follows.
------------------------------------------------------
